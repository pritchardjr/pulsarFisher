This is a simple idea to calculate the Fisher matrix for a Pulsar Timing
Array looking for a stocastic background. The idea is simply to calculate a
Fisher matrix for this and constrain things like the slope and amplitude
of a power law GW background e.g. from inflation. Extensions would look at
stocatic backgrounds from BH-BH inspirals and see how well the angular
moments of this background could be constrained.
